Prior Work:
People use FFTs for machine learning/classification of audio quite regularly. E.g. music tracks, gunshots:

Dataset:
10 samples from each of 35 tests. The tests vary the motor pulse width (this essentially affects how much power is supplied to the motor) from 900 microseconds to 2300 microseconds.  

Each samples is 1 second's worth of magnitude of acceleration in the x, y and z directions collected from the accelerometer at a rate of 1 KHz (i.e. each sample contains 1000 points). This data is then translated from the time domain into the frequency domain via a fast Fourier transform to produce a discrete Fourier transform which represents the distribution of frequencies for each sample in each dimension.

Feature Vectors:
We trialled a number of feature vectors common to analysis of FFTs:
+ A histogram of data that represents an approximation of the distribution.
+ Top frequeÂ ncies
+ Centroid (mean when normalised)

+ Number of peaks
+ Top frequencies in x,y,z
+ Top frequency - average

Machine Learning Methods:
+ SVM
+ Neural Networks
+ K Nearest Neighbour
